## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

### Risk Description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 

### Control Best Practices

The first of the five functions of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is **Identify**. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets—including systems—on business continuity.

### Risk Score
> **Risk Score: 8 / 10 (High)**
> *Justification:* This high score is heavily driven by a lack of access controls, encryption, and adherence to compliance best practices.

## 📝 Audit Findings & Additional Comments

**Impact Rating: Medium**
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium because the IT department does not currently know which assets would be at risk. 

**Regulatory/Fines Risk: High**
The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private and secure. 

### Specific Security Posture Details

**🔴 Vulnerabilities & Missing Controls:**
* **Access Control:** Currently, all Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ **PII/SPII**. Access controls pertaining to **least privilege** and **separation of duties** have *not* been implemented.
* **Cryptography:** **Encryption** is not currently used to ensure the confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database.
* **Network Security:** The IT department has *not* installed an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**.
* **Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery (BCDR):** There are **no disaster recovery plans** currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data.
* **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Although a password policy exists, its requirements are nominal and **not in line with current minimum password complexity requirements** (e.g., at least eight characters, a combination of letters and at least one number, special characters). Furthermore, there is **no centralized password management system** to enforce minimum requirements, leading to productivity issues via frequent IT helpdesk tickets.
* **Vulnerability Management:** While legacy systems are monitored and maintained, there is **no regular schedule** in place for these tasks, and intervention methods are unclear.

**🟢 Existing Positive Controls:**
* **Data Integrity:** The IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.
* **Network Security:** The IT department has a **firewall** that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
* **Endpoint Security:** **Antivirus software** is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department.
* **Incident Response & Privacy:** The IT department has established a plan to **notify E.U. customers within 72 hours** if there is a security breach (GDPR alignment). Additionally, privacy policies, procedures, and processes have been developed and are enforced among IT department members/other employees to properly document and maintain data.
* **Physical Security:** The store’s physical location (main offices, storefront, and warehouse) has **sufficient locks, up-to-date CCTV surveillance,** and **functioning fire detection and prevention systems.**
